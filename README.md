## Explanation


A way to scrap through details such as comments, ratings, reviews,etc about specific app in playstore (in this case MyPertamina) 
and not only scrapping the data, but i visualize the average score reviews on every app version released and created a wordcloud for the comment reviews section
to take a quick look of the sentiment.
